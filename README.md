I own cryptocurrency Chainlink (link) and would like to stake it to receive rewards.  However, staking is limited and they only allow someone new to stake (me) when someone else has unstaked.
I want to create a program that sends me the amount of available space daily in the allotment by scraping the website.  I'm a beginner at python so go easy :)
